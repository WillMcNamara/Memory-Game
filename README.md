# Memory-Game

This game was my first attempt at a react app. The function of the game is to click an image and as long as it isn't an image you have clicked before, your score goes up by one. If you have clicked the picture before then the game resets, and if you reach a new highscore your highscore will be updated. The images are all rearranged randomly upon load and every subsequent click.

I enjoyed working with react and it wasn't too much trouble to get it all working together. Figuring out where and how to apply the game logic was the most difficult thing to wrap my head around. Also, getting the app deployed was a bit of a struggle.
